# ImageGalleryNodeSpike
Example project in the process of creating an ImageGalleryNode using Facebook's AsyncDisplayKit and Pop frameworks.  Image gallery should be a generalized version of their horizontal story view in Paper.

The goal is to get this into its own pod so you can throw these kinds of galleries into any app with minimal configuration.

Right now it offers a few datasource and delegate methods so you can designate the number of subviews in the gallery etc.
